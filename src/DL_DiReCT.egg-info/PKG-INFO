# About DL+DiReCT

DL+DiReCT combines a deep learning-based neuroanatomy segmentation and cortex parcellation with a diffeomorphic registration technique to measure cortical thickness from T1w MRI.

![Abstract](doc/abstract.png)

If you are using DL+DiReCT in your research, please cite ([bibtex](citations.bib)) the corresponding [publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25159):
```

# Installation
## Create virtual environment (optional)
Download and install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html) and create a new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -y -n DL_DiReCT python=3.11
source activate DL_DiReCT
```

## Install DL+DiReCT
```bash
cd ${HOME}
git clone https://github.com/SCAN-NRAD/DL-DiReCT.git
cd DL-DiReCT
pip install -e .
```

# Usage
Run dl+direct on a T1-weighted MRI including skull-stripping (--bet) using [HD-BET](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/HD-BET/) with:
```bash
source activate DL_DiReCT
dl+direct --subject <your_subj_id> --bet <path_to_t1_input.nii.gz> <output_dir>
```

Following files of interest are generated in the output directory:
```
- T1w_norm.nii.gz		Re-sampled input volume
- T1w_norm_seg.nii.gz		Segmentation
- T1w_norm_thickmap.nii.gz	Thickness map
- result-vol.csv		Segmentation volumes
- result-thick.csv		ROI-wise mean cortical thickness
- result-thickstd.csv		ROI-wise standard deviations of cortical thickness
- label_def.csv			Label definitions of the segmentation
```

Results may be collected into FreeSurfer alike statistics files with ```stats2table```.

## Contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI
To process images with a contrast agent (contrast-enhanced), use the option ```--model v6``` ([Rebsamen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26117)).

# Available Models
The following models are available with the ```--model ...``` option:
- ```v0```: Default, for un-enhanced T1w MRI, cortex parcellation with *Desikan-Killiany* atlas ([Rebsamen et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25159))
- ```v6```: For both contrast-enhanced and un-enhanced MRI ([Rebsamen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26117))
- ```v7```: Same as v6, with 74 region per hemisphere according the *Destrieux* atlas ([Rebsamen et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26117))
